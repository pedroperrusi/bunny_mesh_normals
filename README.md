# Bunny Mesh Normals

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you the famous [Stanford Bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny) Triangle Mesh. If you would like to get to know him better, Georgia Tech provides an [overview](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bunny/bunny.html) of his history and Stanford shares [his data source](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) and many other 3D models.

## The Challenge

Given the mesh data of the Stanford bunny, saved in the numpy format, the challenge is to develop a C++ program that computes:

1 - Normalized normals at each face of the object;

2 - Normalized normals at each vertex of the object.
